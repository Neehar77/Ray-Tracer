# Ray-Tracer

This is a ray-tracer project implemented using C++. It supports rendering scenes containing multiple geometric shapes such as spheres, cones, and more, along with various lighting effects.

Features
Geometric Shapes: Supports rendering of spheres, cones, and other basic geometric shapes.
Intersection: Calculates ray intersections with geometric shapes.
Lighting: Implements basic lighting models such as ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
Ray Casting: Utilizes ray casting technique for rendering realistic scenes.
Materials: Supports basic material properties such as color, reflectivity, and transparency.
Shadows: Implements shadows cast by objects onto other objects in the scene.
