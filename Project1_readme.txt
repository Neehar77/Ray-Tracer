Project1:
I have made three header files namely objects, vector and file 
objects: This file includes different classes for objects in a file and scene data.
vector: This file includes various vector operations.
file: This file reads the .nff file and stores the data into objects.

vector.cpp: It has the methods of vector.h header files.
objects.cpp: It has the implementation of objects.h files.
main2.cpp: It includes all the calculation and intersections.


Code is not completed fully, but I tried my best to complete it in time as this my first time learning about graphics and even C++, I would like to learn more
and even know what mistakes I did in this code to improve for mmy next project.
Please consider this I worked very hard for this.

I hade taken help from some of the online sources
